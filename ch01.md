Chapter 1
---------

To learn Python we can start by making a small program that teaches Python by asking programming
questions.

Program that asks questions
===========================

    question = 'How can I get input form a user in Python?'
    answer = 'input()'

Next I will show question on the screen, obtain the answer and check if it is right. You can imagine that your
answers are checked by the most obnoxious, mocking teacher:

    user_answer = input(question)
    if user_answer == answer:
        print('Surely a lucky guess')
    else:
        print('You erred')

Indeed, if you try this code, with right and wrong answers, you will find it gives you the
expected responses.

This small program shows you how to do the following:

    1. create chunks of text
    2. create named variables
    3. get input from a user
    4. check if one thing is equal to another
    5. take on or another action depending on a check or condition

As you can see, these five things were combined in a certain way to achieve a useful function.
That's what programming is -- combining various little "bricks" of actions in a different manner,
depending on your goal.

As far as syntax goes, there are a couple of things to note:

    1. pieces of text are enclosed in single quotes
    2. a single equal sign (=) is used to set value to a variable name
    3. double equality sign (==) is used to check if one thing is equal to another

The 'if' command requires a bit more explanation. It may follow this form:

    if x == y:
        action
    else:
        another action

Note that both the 'if' and 'else' lines are followed by a colon. Also note that the lines with
actions are indented one level compared to the 'if' and 'else' lines -- this is important!

Handle multiple questions
=========================

We now have one question and answer. Let's change it to handle multiple questions and answers:

    questions = [
        'How can I get input form a user in Python?',
        'How can I assign to a variable?'
        ]
    answers = ['input()', '=']

You now have two questions and answers, and you can add as many as you wish in the same way. We'll
also have to change the code that asks the question:

    for number, question in enumerate(questions):
        user_answer = input(question)
    if user_answer == answers[number]:
        print('You have it right this time, merely a lucky guess, for sure!')
    else:
        print('Ha-ha, wrong!')

This will ask a question and then go on to the next question. It would also be easy to let you
retry a few times if you don't get it right.

We've learned three new topics:

    1. lists
    2. the `for` command
    3. `enumerate` command

Let's go over each in some detail:

Lists are very simple: they let you store a number of related items together. A list may be empty
or may contain millions of items. You can add or remove items from a list, and get individual
items by the number (index).

The `for` command allows you to go over items in a list. It can also be used in other circumstances
as we'll soon see. It's similar to the `if` command as it's followed by a colon and the block of
following actions need to be indented.

The `enumerate` command generates sequential index numbers for items in a list. `enumerate` is
usually used with the `for` command.

Including the answer along with the question
============================================
The code above seems to work great but there is a significant flaw in it: it's very error-prone to have
questions and answers in separate lists because it would be so easy to mis-align them! It's far better to have
the answer next to the question, but how shall we update the code to fit?

    questions = [
        ['How can I get input form a user in Python?',
            'input()'],

        ['How can I assign to a variable?',
            '='],
        ]

As you can see, you can fit a list inside of another list. Here is the accompanying code:

    for question, right_answer in questions:
        user_answer = input(question)
        if user_answer == right_answer:
            print('Surely a lucky guess')
        else:
            print('You erred')

This version of code is actually much simpler than the last, while the structure of `questions` list is a bit
more complex. This brings up an important point: if you set up the data structure carefully to suit your
needs, the logic part of code is much easier to write and modify. Oftentimes, when data structure is chosen
right, you've already solved the problem or, at least, you've come much closer to solving it. It takes some
experience and knowledge of Python data structures to accomplish that, but the effort is well worth it.

Adding more questions
=====================
As you follow the tutorial you can add more question to the test and add logic to randomly select questions.
We'll go over the `random` library in a bit.

Eventually you will be able to add more question types such as multiple valid answers, multiple choice questions.

A word puzzle
-------------

It only takes a few lines of code to make a simple puzzle game. In this game you will try to find
missing letters.

A random word list
==================
First, I've found a list of random words on the internet and will make a list of out them; you can
easily find other random word-lists online:

    import random
    words = "adult aeroplane air aircraft carrier airforce airport album alphabet apple arm army baby baby backpack balloon banana bank barbecue bathroom bathtub bed bed bee bible bible bird bomb book boss bottle bowl box boy brain bridge butterfly button cappuccino car car-race carpet carrot cave chair chess board chief child chisel chocolates church church circle circus circus clock clown coffee coffee-shop comet compact disc compass computer crystal cup cycle data base desk diamond dress drill drink drum dung ears earth egg electricity elephant eraser explosive eyes family fan feather festival film finger fire floodlight flower foot fork freeway fruit fungus game garden gas gate gemstone girl gloves god grapes guitar hammer hat hieroglyph highway horoscope horse hose ice ice-cream insect jet fighter junk kaleidoscope kitchen knife leather jacket leg library liquid magnet man map maze meat meteor microscope milk milkshake mist money $$$$ monster mosquito mouth nail navy necklace needle onion paintbrush pants parachute passport pebble pendulum pepper perfume pillow plane planet pocket post-office potato printer prison pyramid radar rainbow record restaurant rifle ring robot rock rocket roof room rope saddle salt sandpaper sandwich satellite school sex ship shoes shop shower signature skeleton slave snail software solid space shuttle spectrum sphere spice spiral spoon sports-car spot light square staircase star stomach sun sunglasses surveyor swimming pool sword table tapestry teeth telescope television tennis racquet thermometer tiger toilet tongue torch torpedo train treadmill triangle tunnel typewriter umbrella vacuum vampire videotape vulture water weapon web wheelchair window woman worm x-ray"
    words = words.split()
    word = random.choice(words)

There are a few things that happen here:

    1. we are importing the `random` library.
    2. we are creating a text containing words.
    3. we are using the `split()` command to split the text string into a list.
    4. finally we are choosing a random word using the `choice()` command that lives in the `random` library.

Making a copy and hiding some of the letters
============================================
Let's keep 30% of letters in a word and hide the rest. First I will outline the steps we'll need to do:

    - Calculate the exact number of letters to hide.
    - Create a list of word's letters.
    - Create a list of letter indexes (from 0 to x where x is one less than word length).
    - Repeat these commands as long as necessary to hide all letters:
        * pick a random index
        * remove it from index list
        * in the list of letters, replace relevant letter with an underscore

The code below is only a bit longer than the list of steps in our outline!

    word_length = len(word)
    hide_letters = word_length * 0.70
    hide_letters = int(hide_letters)

    display_word = word
    display_list = list(display_word)

    num_hidden = 0
    indexes = range(word_length)
    index_list = list(indexes)

    while num_hidden < hide_letters:
        index = random.choice(index_list)
        index_list.remove(index)
        display_list[index] = '_'
        num_hidden += 1

Here's what we've done in the snippet above:

    1. Found length of the word using `len()` command.
    2. Calculated number of letters to hide by multiplying by 0.70 to get 70% of that number.
    3. Most of time this will give us a fractional number, like 5.3; we converted it to an
       integer using the `int()` command.
    4. Copied the word to `display_word` using `=` operator.
    5. Created a display list of letters using `list()` command.
    6. Made a range of letter indexes using the `range()` command.
    7. Converted that range into a list using the same `list()` command.
    8. Used `while` command to continue running a set of commands until we are done; '<' operator to check
       that `num_hidden` is less than `hide_letters`.
    9. Used the `choice()` command again.
    10. Removed the index from list of indexes so that we don't try to remove the same letter two
        times.
    11. Replaced the letter with an underscore.
    12. Incremented the `num_hidden` to keep track of how many we have hidden.

Letting player guess the letters
================================
To let player display the letters, you can use the following code:

    space = ' '
    print(space.join(display_list))
    index = int(input('index: '))
    guess = input('guess: ')
    if word[index] == guess:
        print("Right!")
    else:
        print("Wrong!")

Only a single command here is new to you:

    - `join` will create a piece of text out of a list by joining it with a separator string of text.

The word displayed would look similar to this:

    a _ _ e _ a

Elevator Simulation
-------------------
It's fairly common for programming tutorials to use elevator simulations as an example. I thought it would be
good to make a simple simulation for this tutorial, too.

Let's start by taking stock of what we need to track: what is the current location of the elevator, what is
the top floor, and what are the floors requested via buttons both inside and outside the elevator.

Here is an interesting question: do we need to keep separate track of whether a button was pressed inside or
outside? Is it the same thing, functionally? Dwell on this for a bit because this is a good example of a
"design question". Obviously, the buttons are actually located in separate places, physically, but do we care
to track where exactly it was pressed?

Let's start by creating the variables:

    max_floor = 9
    current = 0
    requested = [5]

`requested` is, of course, a list, because we need to allow multiple people to use the elevator at the same
time - not a good user experience otherwise, is it!

Now let us create a function that will move the elevator. What is a function? A function in this case is like
an elevator attendant such as you can still see in some buildings in New York. He or She operates the elevator
and inputs the floor numbers visitors ask for.

First, the steps we'll need to do:

    1. Check if there are any requested floors; only proceed if there are.
    2. Remove the first requested floor.
    3. Create the "step" direction for going up or down - going up is 1 because we need to add to get to the
       next floor, and going down is -1 because we subtract to go one floor down.
    4. Keep changing the floor until we get to the goal.

    def operate():
        global current
        if requested:
            floor = requested[0]
            del requested[0]
            if current <= floor:
                step = 1
            else:
                step = -1
            for fl in range(current+step, floor+step, step):
                print("Going to "+str(fl))
                current = fl
            print("done!")

    operate()

Let's look into the code above. We use the following commands:

    1. `def` stands for `define`, to create a new function. It has the form of

        `def` name():

       which is then followed by indented block of code that contains the body of the function.

    2. I used the `global` command because a function does not have permission to change a numeric or a string
       variable that lives outside the function. `global` grants the permission to change the `current` floor.

    3. `<=` operator checks if one thing is less or equal than another.

Range command
=============

`range` command deserves a bit more explanation. It will normally work in this manner:

    range(5,10,1)
    5, 6, 7, 8, 9

It starts at the first argument and goes to one below the second. There is a sensible reason for that: You can
cover a full range with multiple smaller non-overlapping ranges, e.g. from 1 to 20 by giving range(1,5),
range(5,15) and range(15,21).

The third argument is the step, which can be set to some other value, for example, to -1 (but also to 2, 3,
etc):

    range(10,5,-1)
    10, 9, 8, 7, 6

As we need to be able to go up or down, we first figure out whether the step is positive or negative one, and
then give it to the `range` command. We also need to make sure that the first argument is the one following
current floor, and the second is the one following the target floor:

    range(current+step, floor+step, step):

More Good Elevators
===================
Elevators can be surprisingly smart (although in real world they never are). You may try to program
a pool of elevators where each may serve its own range of floors, or half of the pool may serve one range and
the other half, the rest.

As the same programming logic may be reused for different buildings you can write it in a way that would adapt
to the exact layout and number of elevators in each building.

You may also consider that safety features are very important in elevators and you can add sensors that check
if there is obstruction (for example, a human) in the way before closing the doors. You can also check if the
doors closed completely. And then there's all kinds of extras you can add, for example calling for help when
the elevator is stuck, calling fire department, stopping between floors to access the secret floors, omitting
13th floor for the superstitious among us, having special behaviour for when there is a fire: shutting down
elevators but allowing active ones to let people out at the closest floor, having a freight elevator that
allows more weight in and larger items, and many more things you can make up. The only limit is your
imagination, you can even have a flying Willy-Wonka style elevator if you wish.

A simple race game
==================
One of the oldest types of games is a race game, similar to horses or sprinters racing to the finish.

The simplest version would have two players that make random rolls and move across the board until one of them
wins by reaching the finish line. We don't even really need the board per se -- we could simply track the
locations of players and display them on-the-fly when showing the game board. However, it will be easier to
follow the tutorial and to add more features if there's a list that represents the board.

Our plan is to create the racetrack list which will be 20 spaces long, to add players (represented by letters
a and b), to display the racetrack and to create logic for the move.

    playera = 'a'
    playerb = 'b'
    loc_a = loc_b = -1
    racetrack = [' '] * 20
    print( ''.join(racetrack) )

Note that multiplying a list with a single item by an integer creates a list with N items.

Let's go ahead and add logic that makes the move -- including the win condition and handling the case when
space is occupied by the other player. The logic will look like this:

    - update player A location by random integer
    - test if new location is past the goalpost and, therefore, is a WIN
    - test if new locaiton is occupied by player B
    - if we can, remove player A from old location and add to the new location


    import random
    last_location = 19
    loc_a += randint(1, 6)
    if loc_a >= last_location:
        print("player a wins!")
    elif racetrack[loc_a] == playerb:
        pass
    else:
        racetrack[loc_a] = playera

Similar code can be used to move playber B.

While this code works fine, there are a few issues with it -- it should be generalized to handle an arbitrary
player. Then you won't need to copy the code for each new player added to the game.

The game itself is not very interesting because it depends entirely on chance, but it would not be hard to add
some tactical and strategic elements. For example, we could let the players have some special abilities and
perhaps limit the number of times some of them may be used. Some of the abilities may be:

    - swap places with the opposing player
    - force opposing player to make the next move backwards
    - double current move
    - move to a random location on the racetrack instead of moving forward sequentially (this may be balanced
      by a small chance of losing instantly)

In addition, some game tiles may have special effect:

    - prison, lose a move or two
    - propel forward
    - bounce back
    - move all players randomly

Many other features can be added! We'll come back to this game and improve it by adding some of these features.

Tetris
======

Tetris is a perennial favorite, and for a good reason. We won't make a full tetris right away but for now
we'll just look at how you can add all pieces and rotate them.

First we'll make a game board, which is going to be a list of rows, where each row is a list of tiles. The
board size will be 6 columns by 10 rows:

    def make_row(size):
        return ['.'] * size

    board = []
    for x in range(10):
        board.append(make_row(6))

    for row in board:
        print( ''.join(row) )

Let's make two tetris pieces, to start with: the long stick and the L-shape, in a 4x4 template
similar to the game board, except for the size.

The L shape will be defined from the upper-left corner which will be encoded as 0,0 coordinate.
We'll mark the piece tiles with a hash sign (#):

    lshape = []
    for x in range(4):
        lshape.append(make_row(4))
    # L-shape
    lshape_tiles = [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (0,1)]
    for x,y in lshape_tiles:
        lshape[y][x] = '#'

You can display the piece the same way you displayed the board.

Now we'll insert the piece into the board:

    lshape_anchor = 0,0
    for x,y in lshape_tiles:
        board[y][x] = '#'

Why do we need the anchor? So that we know where the piece is on board, and so that we can have it fall down,
move sideways, and rotate it.

Falling is easier than rotation, so let's try moving it first -- first we'll clear all tiles and then populate
new tiles. First let's assume anchor is at 0,0 and then we'll modify the code for any anchor location.

    for x, y in lshape_tiles:
        board[y][x] = '.'
        board[y+1][x] = '#'

There are some checks you will need to do here to make sure the piece won't intersect with another piece, and
will rest on top of pieces below, or on the bottom if there are no pieces below.

Here's how you can account for the anchor point location:

    xa, ya = lshape_anchor
    for x, y in lshape_tiles:
        newx = xa + x
        newy = ya + y
        board[newy][newx] = '.'
        board[newy+1][newx] = '#'
    lshape_anchor = newy+1, newx

Note that we are not doing anything with `newx`, so we don't actually need it, but it gives you an example of
how to use the same code for both vertical and sideway moves.

Tetris rotation
===============
Let's rotate our piece now! There's different way to approach this, but let's try a clockwise rotation with
the 4x4 template rotating so that each corner ends up in the "next" corner, -- rather than rotating the piece
itself.

Rotation is easy to understand visually -- make a drawing of two 4x4 grids and trace how a few random tiles
change coordinates when rotated clock-wise:

    0,0 -> 4,0
    1,0 -> 4,1
    1,1 -> 3,1
    2,1 -> 2,1
    2,2 -> 2,2

As you can see, `x` is directly translated to the new `y`, and the `x` is calculated by subtracting 4 from old
`y`:

    newx = 4-y
    newy = x

When rotating, you also need to check if the new position will overlap with an existing piece or a wall, and
refuse to rotate if so.

If you ever played Tetris, you will know that filled lines disappear from screen and anything above them "falls
down" by correpsonding number of lines.

You can do this by going one line up from the bottom and checking if the line is filled up. We can do that by
starting at last line's index which is 9, ending at 0 index for the top-most line, and using step of -1 to go
backwards. As a reminder: `range()` command's second argument is one after the one you want to stop at, so if
you want to stop at 0 going backwards, the argument is `-1`.


    # start, stop, step
    for n in range(9, -1, -1):
        row = board[n]
        if row[0] == row[1] == row[2] == row[3] == row[4] == row[5] == '.':
            # clear the row

How do we clear the row? We can just delete it from board and insert a blank row at the beginning (top) of
board -- that seems to be the easiest approach because you don't need any extra work to let extra rows fall down.

This is a good example of how normal behaviour of Python lists aligns nicely with our purpose. It doesn't
always work out so nicely, but in this case we are lucky - yay.

However, there is a subtle problem that is easy to miss and tricky to find because it will only happen in the
case when you have two completed rows one after another. We are using the `n` index which will make us skip --
and miss -- one row. In other words, if you have rows A,B and C, and you skip A in one iteration, `n` will
point to C in the next iteration. This means we lose B!

A simple way to fix this is to first delete all rows in one pass and then to insert the same number of empty
rows at the beginning (top) of board:

    deleted_count = 0
    for n in range(9, -1, -1):
        row = board[n]
        if row[0] == row[1] == row[2] == row[3] == row[4] == row[5] == '.':
            del board[n]
            deleted_count += 1
    new_rows = [make_row(6) for x in range(deleted_count)]
    board = new_rows + board

There're certainly more elegant ways to check if a row is empty -- we'll come back to Tetris later and update
this code and add more pieces & features.

A Text Adventure
================

Text adventure games are easy to make and are only limited by your imagination. First we'll make a few
locations and add a command to move and look around.

To make things easy we'll only make five locations for now. They will be sequential and stored in a list.
Moving to the next / previous location will be done with n/p keys. To look around, you will use the 'l' key:

    locations = [[] for x in range(5)]
    loc = 0
    current = locations[loc]
    i = input('> ')

    if i=='n':
        loc += 1
    elif i=='p':
        loc -= 1
    elif i=='l':
        if not current:
            print("This location seems to be empty")

    current = locations[loc]

Let's make a few items and add them randomly. Items will be encoded by integers

    apple = 1
    gem = 2
    piece_of_string = 3
    mysteriuos_note = 4
    note_text = ""
